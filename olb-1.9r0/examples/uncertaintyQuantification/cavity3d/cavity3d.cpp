/**
 * @brief UQ (Uncertainty Quantification) parameter setup:
 *
 * 1) Monte Carlo Sampling (Uncomment #define MonteCarloSampling):
 *    - Uses random draws (nq samples) from the specified distributions.
 *    - The number of samples nq can be set as an integer. Increasing nq yields
 *      more statistically robust results at higher computational cost.
 *    - Convergence Rate:
 *      - The Monte Carlo error typically decreases on the order of 1/sqrt(nq).
 *      - Consequently, to gain one extra digit of accuracy, the sample size nq must
 *        increase by about a factor of 100.
 *    - Example code block:
 *         int nq = resolution / 3.0;
 *         unsigned int seed = 123456; // fixed seed for reproducibility
 *         uq.initializeMonteCarlo(nq, dist, seed);
 *
 * 2) Stochastic Collocation (Default, #define stochasticCollocationMethod):
 *    - Implements generalized polynomial chaos (GPC).
 *    - Configure the polynomial expansion order (orderGPC) and the number
 *      of quadrature points per dimension (nqPerDim).
 *    - The total number of samples is (nqPerDim)^(number_of_dimensions).
 *    - Convergence Rate:
 *      - For smooth problems, polynomial-based methods like GPC can achieve
 *        exponential (spectral) convergence as the polynomial order is increased.
 *      - However, increasing orderGPC or nqPerDim grows the number of simulations
 *        rapidly, especially in high-dimensional parameter spaces.
 *    - Example code block:
 *         int orderGPC = 2;  // polynomial chaos order
 *         int nqPerDim = 3;  // quadrature points per dimension
 *         uq.initializeGPC(orderGPC, nqPerDim, dist);
 *
 * Adjust these parameters according to the desired accuracy and computational
 * resources. Higher order or more samples generally capture broader variations
 * but increase runtime.
